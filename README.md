I’m excited to share a recent feature I implemented in Power BI: Dynamic Tooltips! This feature allows users to gain deeper insights by displaying additional context when hovering over data points. Here’s a quick breakdown of how it works and why it’s beneficial:

🔍 𝗦𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗼:
Imagine you’re analysing sales data, and you want your report users to see detailed product information (like category, average rating, or regional sales) without cluttering the main view. With dynamic tooltips, users can hover over a data point and instantly view relevant details tailored to the context.

💡 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀:

1. 👍 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Dynamic tooltips provide on-demand insights, making your reports more interactive and informative without overwhelming the main dashboard.
2. 📊 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Customize the information shown in tooltips to match the specific needs of your audience. Whether it’s sales trends, customer demographics, or product performance, the right data is always just a hover away.
3. 🎨 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀: Keep your main visuals focused and clutter-free while still providing access to detailed information when needed.

✨ 𝗣𝗿𝗼 𝗧𝗶𝗽: Start by identifying the key metrics that add value when analyzed in detail. Then, set up your tooltips to dynamically adjust based on the selected data point.
